# Cursor Rules for Laravel + Livewire + Flux UI

These rules guide how Cursor AI should assist inside this project.

---

## 🔒 General Rules
- ❌ Do **NOT** create any markdown (`.md`) files unless I explicitly request it.
- ❌ Do **NOT** create demo/example files, scaffolding, or documentation without my permission.
- ✅ Only generate code/files that I directly ask for.
- ✅ Always confirm before adding new dependencies.
- ✅ Ask me for clarification if something is ambiguous.

---

## 🖥️ Tech Stack
- Backend: **Laravel (PHP 8+)**
- Components: **Livewire**
- UI: **Flux UI**
- Database: Laravel Eloquent ORM & migrations

---

## 📐 Coding Standards
- Follow **Laravel best practices** for controllers, models, migrations, factories, and Livewire components.
- Use **Flux UI conventions** consistently in Blade templates.
- Write **strictly typed PHP 8+** wherever possible.
- Follow **PSR-12 formatting**.
- Add **docblocks for public methods**.
- Keep code **readable and maintainable**, not overly compact.

---

## ⚡ Livewire Rules
- Keep components **small and focused**.
- Use correct **binding between backend and frontend**.
- Respect **Laravel naming conventions**.
- Avoid adding extra demo props or example states.

---

## 🧪 Testing
- Framework: **Pest** (preferred for Laravel).
- Write **unit + feature tests** alongside real functionality.

---

## 🌱 Git
